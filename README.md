# VisionX3Annos 

## Overview 
VisionX3Annos is an educational password security simulation tool written in Python.
It demonstrates how weak passwords can be guessed through automated random number combinations and why proper security controls—such as strong passwords, rate limiting, and multi-factor authentication—are critical.

⚠️ This project is intended strictly for learning and security awareness purposes.

## Purpose 
- Demonstrate how weak password patterns are vulnerable to automated guessing
- Help learners understand brute-force logic and request handling
- Promote ethical cybersecurity practices and defensive thinking
- Practice Python automation using requests and mechanize

## This tool must only be used on:
- Accounts you personally own
- Explicitly authorized test accounts
- Local or mock authentication systems

## Features
- Randomized numeric password generation logic
- Automated request handling
- Colored terminal output using lolcat
- Simple, beginner-friendly Python structure
- Demonstrates why rate limiting and lockout policies matter
